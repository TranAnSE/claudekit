|-------|-------------|
| `security` | OWASP, vulnerabilities, auth |
| `performance` | Efficiency, caching, queries |
| `architecture` | Patterns, coupling, design |
| `testing` | Coverage, test quality |

## MCP Integration

This mode leverages MCP servers for thorough review:

### Playwright
```
For UI/frontend reviews:
- Render and verify visual changes
- Test responsive behavior
- Check accessibility
- Capture screenshots for comparison
```

### Sequential Thinking
```
For systematic code analysis:
- Step through logic methodically
- Track multiple concerns
- Build comprehensive issue list
```

### Memory
```
Apply consistent review standards:
- Recall past review decisions
- Remember approved patterns
- Track recurring issues
```

### Filesystem
```
For thorough code examination:
- Use read_file to examine code
- Use search_files to find related patterns
- Check consistency across codebase
```

## Combines Well With

- `review` skill (user-invocable PR review)
- `security-review` skill (user-invocable security audit)
- Deep research mode (for thorough audits)
- `security-auditor` agent, `code-reviewer` agent
